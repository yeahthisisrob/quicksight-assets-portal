* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Include both positive and negative test cases
* Mock AWS SDK calls appropriately

### Commit Messages

* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Project Structure

Before contributing, familiarize yourself with the project structure:

* `/backend` - Node.js/Express backend
  * `/routes` - API endpoints
  * `/services` - Business logic and AWS integrations
  * `/utils` - Utility functions
* `/frontend` - React/TypeScript frontend
